                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <li>80-100g of fresh, sashimi-quality salmon fillet, 1cm thick, skinned and boned</li>
                    <li>1 avocado</li>
                    <li>1 bunch of chives</li>
                    <li>2 sheets of nori</li>
                    <li>handfuls of cooked sushi rice</li>
                    <li>white crabmeat</li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Directions</h3>
                    <p>(note, you will need a sushi mat)</p>
                    <li>Slice the salmon lengthways into 1cm-wide strips. You should be able to get 2 x 20cm long strips from an 80-100g slice of salmon (although you may need to use a larger number of shorter strips, depending on the shape of the fish).</li>
                    <li>Cut the avocado in half lengthways around the stone. Twist and separate the two halves. Holding the half with the stone, tap the stone firmly and carefully with the sharp point of a knife blade and twist – the stone should lift out easily. Peel the skin neatly and slice the avocado lengthways into ½cm-wide crescent-shaped pieces. Wash the chives and leave the strands whole.</li>
                    <li>You will be able to see some thin lines on the nori seaweed sheets. Place a whole sheet shiny side down at the bottom of the sushi mat, with the lines of the sheet lying horizontally across the mat.</li>
                    <li>Wet your fingers in a bowl of water, and shake off any excess. Damp fingers help when handling sticky sushi rice. Look for the 2nd line from the top of the nori sheet, about 3-4cm down. Keeping the top 3-4cm of the sheet clear, spread a handful of rice (roughly 160 g) over the sheet evenly and gently with your fingertips. Do not use too much rice and do not press it on to the sheet. It must be a very thin layer of rice.</li>
                    <li>Place half the salmon, half the chives, half the crabmeat and half the avocado side by side, in the centre of the rice, along the length of the nori. You can add some wasabi to the rice before you add the other ingredients, if you like.</li>
                    <li>Rolling the sushi:
Holding the fillings in place with your index fingers, start rolling with the mat from the bottom edge of the nori towards the top of the rice edge. Keep rolling 3 or 4 times, and each time you roll, open the mat and make sure that it is tightly rolled, so that there are no gaps between the fillings and the nori.</li>
                    <li>Repeat with the remaining nori sheet and filling ingredients, then cut each roll into 8-10 pieces.</li>
                    <li>Tips: Buy the crab cooked and picked from your fishmonger. You could also use tinned crabmeat, and chopped spring onion instead of chives. But be sparing with the spring onions, as they are stronger. Use a perfectly ripe avocado.</li>
